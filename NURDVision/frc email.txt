Hello, my name is Mike from FRC team 3255 the SuperNURDs, and we are very interested in using your ZED camera for use in the FRC challenges. although, the FRC rules and guidelines do not allow use of materials over $400. We were wondering if you would allow us to purchase a camera for $400 for use on our robot, as your camera is currently priced at $449.
